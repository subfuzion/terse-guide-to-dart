# Introduction

## This is a draft version

This guide is intentionally terse.

The content is condensed primarily from the [online Dart documentation](https://dart.dev/guides). It is structured in a way that is intended for experienced programmers to get hands-on with Dart as quickly as possible without wading through more comprehensive reference material.

The guide begins not with the Dart language but with the structure of Dart application and library packages.

Experienced programmers, particularly those who have had exposure to other object-oriented languages and C-style syntax, should not find much of a struggle with the Dart language. Presenting an overview of packages and package management first allows these programmers to dive into actual Dart development sooner.
